# Heart Disease Prediction App

This project is a simple and interactive machine learning web application built using **Streamlit**. It predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a person based on medical inputs using a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on healthcare data.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface using Streamlit
- Takes 13 medical inputs from the user
- Displays risk prediction along with the probability
- Shows dynamic messages for "High Risk" or "Low Risk"
- Includes disclaimer for ethical AI use

## Files in this Repository

- `app.py` – Streamlit app script to run the web application
- `heart_disease_model.pkl` – Trained Random Forest ML model
- `heart-disease-predictor.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, training, and model optimization
- `requirements.txt` – List of Python dependencies to run the app

## Installation & Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kapilsingh001/heart-disease-predictor.git
cd heart-disease-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
